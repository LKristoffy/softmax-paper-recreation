# Softmax Paper Recreation

This repository contains a recreation of the toy model experiments described in the paper [**"Softmax is Not Enough (for Sharp Out-of-Distribution Detection)"**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01104) by Petar Veličković, Christos Perivolaropoulos, Federico Barbero, and Razvan Pascanu.

## Overview

The paper addresses the limitations of softmax-based methods for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection and introduces alternative approaches to achieve sharper OOD detection. This repository reproduces the key toy model experiments to provide a practical demonstration of the paper’s concepts.

## Repository Contents

- **`README.md`**: This file, containing details about the repository and its usage.
